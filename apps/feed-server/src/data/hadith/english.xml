Yahya said: Narrate from me that both these traditions are weak in respect of their chains. Abu Dawud said: Al-Thawri is reported to have said: Habib narrated this tradition to us only on the authority of 'Urwat al-Muzani, that is, he did not narrated any tradition on the authority of 'Urwah b. al-Zubair.

Walid, you are wronging him, for he has kept back his courts of mail and weapons to use them in Allah’s path. As for al-Abbas, the uncle of the Messenger of Allah(May peace be upon him), I shall be responsible for it and an equal amount along with it.

The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: There is no distinction between us and Banu 'Abd al-Muttalib in pre-Islamic days and in Islam.

For there is a closed door between you and them.” ‘Umar said: “Will that door be broken or opened?” I said: “No, it will be broken.” ‘Umar said: “Then it will never be closed.’” We asked Hudhaifah: “Did ‘Umar know what that door meant?” He said: "Yes, just as he knows that there will be night before morning, because I narrated to him a Hadith in which there are no errors.” We were afraid to ask him who the door was, so we said to Masruq: “Ask him." He said: “‘Umar.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  &lt;b&gt; Grades of authenticity &lt;/b&gt; Al-Albani(Sahih), Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi(Sahih), Zubair Ali Zai(Sahih - Agreed Upon)</description>

Abu Musa said, "I heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'Ask permission to enter three times. If you are given permission, then enter. If not, go away.' ''Umar said, "Who can confirm this? If you do not bring me someone to confirm it, I will do such-and-such to you." Abu Musa went out until he came to an assembly in the mosque which was called the Majlis-al-Ansar. He said, "I told Umar ibn al-Khattab that I heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'Ask permission three times. If you are given permission, then enter. If not, go away.' Umar said, 'If you do not bring me someone who can confirm it, I will do such- and-such to you'. If any of you have heard that, let him come with me.' " They said to Abu Said al-Khudri, "Go with him". Abu Said was the youngest of them. He went with him and told Umar ibn al-Khattab about that."

   Narrated Imran ibn Husayn: The Prophet (ﷺ) led (us) in the noon prayer, and a man came and recited behind him "Glorify the name of thy Lord, the Most High" (Surah 87). When he finished (the prayer), he said: Which of you recited? They (the people) said: A man (recited). He said: I knew that some one of you confused me in it (in the recitation of the Qur'an). Abu Dawud said: Abu al-Walid said in his version: Shu'bah said: I asked Qatadah: Did Sa'id not say: Listen attentively to the Qur'an? He replied: (Yes), but that applies to prayer in which it (the Qur'an) is recited aloud. Ibn Kathir said in his version: I said to Qatadah: Perhaps he (the Prophet) disliked it (recitation). He said: If he had disliked it, he would have prohibited it &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  &lt;b&gt; Grades of authenticity &lt;/b&gt; Al-Albani(Sahih), Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid(Sahih), Shuaib Al Arnaut(Sahih), Zubair Ali Zai(Sahih Muslim (398))</description>

   Muadh bin Jabal narrated:"I saw the Prophet when he performed Wudu, he wiped his face with the edge of his garment." Abu Eisa said: This Hadith is gharib, and its chain is weak. Rishdin bin Sa'd and Abdur- Rahman bin Ziyad bin An'um Al Ifriqi [narrators in the chain of this Hadith] are weak in Hadith. Some people of knowledge among the Companions of the Prophet and those after them, permitted using a towel after Wudu. Those who disliked it, only disliked it from the view of the saying: "Wudu is weighed." That as reported from Sa'eed bin Al- Musayyab and Az-Zuhri. Muhammad bin Humaid [Ar-Razi] narrated to us, Jarir narrated to us, he said: Ali bin Mujahid narrated to me, and he is trustworthy to me, from me, from: Tha'labah from Az-Zuhri, he said: "The towel is only disliked after Wudu because Wudu is weighed &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  &lt;b&gt; Grades of authenticity &lt;/b&gt; Ahmad Muhammad Shakir(Daif Isnaad), Al-Albani(Daif Isnaad), Bashar Awad Maarouf(Daif), Zubair Ali Zai(Daif)</description>
